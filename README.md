# Employee Salary & Department Insights

##  Project Overview
This project analyzes employee salary data to uncover compensation patterns across departments and job titles. Using SQL, I answered business-driven questions that can support HR and management decision-making.

## Tools & Technologies
- SQL
- Relational Database (Employees sample database)

## Dataset
The database contains the following tables:
- employees
- departments

- A small number of employees earn disproportionately high salaries.

## Key Insights 
 The analysis utilized multi table JOINS, agrregate function and subuert with the HAVING clause to compare the average salary against the job title.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates my ability to use SQL to analyze real-world employee data, apply aggregations and filters, and extract meaningful business insights.

## Next Steps
- Visualize insights using Python (Pandas & Matplotlib)
- Perform salary trend analysis over time
