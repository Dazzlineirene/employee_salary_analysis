# Employee Salary & Department Insights

##  Project Overview
This project analyzes employee salary data to uncover compensation patterns across departments and job titles. Using SQL, I answered business-driven questions that can support HR and management decision-making.

## Tools & Technologies
- SQL
- Relational Database (Employees sample database)

## Dataset
The database contains the following tables:
- employees
- departments
- dept_emp
- salaries
- titles

## Questions Answered
- Which departments have the highest average salaries?
- Who are the top 10 highest-paid employees?
- Which departments have the most employees?
- How does salary vary by job title?
- Which job titles earn above-average salaries?
- How does salary differ by department and job title?

## Key Insights
- Certain departments consistently offer higher average salaries.
- Senior job titles earn significantly more than entry-level roles.
- Salary variation is more influenced by job title than department.
- A small number of employees earn disproportionately high salaries.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates my ability to use SQL to analyze real-world employee data, apply aggregations and filters, and extract meaningful business insights.

## Next Steps
- Visualize insights using Python (Pandas & Matplotlib)
- Perform salary trend analysis over time
